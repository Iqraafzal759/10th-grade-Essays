        <h1>A True Muslim</h1>

        <p>Islam is a perfect religion. It offers solutions to every problem. The followers of Islam are called Muslims. Being a Muslim is a great blessing, but being a true Muslim is like icing on the cake.</p>

        <blockquote>“A true Muslim is one who follows the teachings of Islam in the real sense.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim lives according to the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) and the commandments of the Holy Quran. A true Muslim has firm faith in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Allah Almighty</li>
            <li>Holy Prophets</li>
            <li>Heavenly Books</li>
            <li>Angels</li>
            <li>The Day of Judgment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A true Muslim offers five prayers a day on time. In preparation for prayer, a true Muslim performs ablution five times a day to cleanse himself/herself from all kinds of impurities. He never misses any prayer because he knows that:</p>

        <blockquote>“Prayer is the pillar of Islam.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim observes fasting in every Ramadan because he knows that fasting is one of the most significant pillars of Islam. It strengthens him spiritually and physically.</p>

        <blockquote>“Fasting is a shield between a person and his sins.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>Alms giving is another quality found in a true Muslim. A true Muslim spends his money on the poor and needy because he knows that giving alms is a means of atonement for some of his sins.</p>

        <blockquote>“A man’s true wealth is the good deeds he does in the world.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim has compassion for humanity. He never says words that could hurt others. Our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) said:</p>

        <blockquote>“A true Muslim is one from whose hands and tongue others are safe.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>Thus, a true Muslim is an embodiment of courtesy and good deeds. Whenever he meets others, he greets them by saying Assalam-o-Alaikum. After that, he inquires about their health and well-being because he knows that the Quran emphasizes this form of greeting.</p>

        <p>A true Muslim also values cleanliness and maintains it by offering five prayers a day.</p>

        <blockquote>“Cleanliness is half of faith.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>The Holy Quran is the last heavenly book and a source of guidance for the entire Muslim Ummah. A true Muslim learns and teaches the Holy Quran because he follows the words of our beloved Prophet (S.A.W):</p>

        <blockquote>“A true Muslim is the one who learns and teaches the Holy Quran.”<br>— Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W)</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim has immense love for our beloved Rasool, Hazrat Muhammad (S.A.W). He always follows the sayings of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) because he is well aware of the following verse from the Holy Quran:</p>

        <blockquote>“O Muslims! Follow the commands of Allah Almighty and His Prophet (S.A.W).”<br>— Surah Al-Anfal</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim also knows that Islam emphasizes justice. Therefore, he deals fairly and justly with others, as commanded by Allah Almighty:</p>

        <blockquote>“O Muslims! Be just, as Allah loves those who practice justice.”<br>— Al-Quran</blockquote>

        <p>A true Muslim respects the faith of others. He is always ready to sacrifice for the sake of Islam. We pray to Allah Almighty to guide us on the straight path and make us true Muslims. Ameen!</p>
