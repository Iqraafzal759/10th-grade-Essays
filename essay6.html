        <h1>A Hockey Match</h1>

        <p>Sports and games play an important role in our lives. They are as beneficial as food and water. They make us healthy, as we know that:</p>

        <blockquote>“The first wealth is health.”<br>— Emerson</blockquote>

        <p>Being healthy is one of the basic needs of life, and the things that make us healthy, active, and smart are sports.</p>

        <blockquote>“Sport preserves health.”<br>— Hippocrates</blockquote>

        <p>There are many indoor as well as outdoor games. All games, including hockey, teach us many good qualities. They teach us to be confident, as confidence is needed in almost every field of life.</p>

        <blockquote>“Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.”<br>— Helen Keller</blockquote>

        <p>A hockey match teaches us to follow the rules. It makes us disciplined. Discipline is the practice of making people obey rules and laws. It is important, as it leads to a successful and meaningful life.</p>

        <blockquote>“Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.”<br>— Jim Rohn</blockquote>

        <p>Pakistani students also actively participate in hockey. They play hockey just like other sports because they understand well that:</p>

        <blockquote>“All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.”<br>— James Howell</blockquote>

        <p>I was delighted to witness a hockey match between Pakistan and Germany at the Hockey Stadium recently. The Germans dominated in the beginning, but the Pakistani players fought back and coordinated remarkably. The Germans made strong attempts, but our goalkeeper made spectacular saves. The match was briefly suspended when the home crowd fired crackers, causing dense smoke to spread all around.</p>

        <p>The Pakistani forwards kept possession of the ball and played in an open, professional, and coordinated manner. Pakistan attacked mostly from the flanks, but the Germans' speed and timely interceptions saved them. Our left half took the ball from the German attackers and, after running a few steps, sent a through pass to the inside left. He dispatched the ball towards the goal with a flick. Another Pakistani player, who was closely following him, pushed the ball to score the goal.</p>

        <blockquote>“Every day is a great day for hockey.”<br>— Mario Lemieux</blockquote>
