        <h1>Quaid-e-Azam</h1>

        <p>Few people can change the course of history. Few can alter the map of the world. Such people always face big obstacles, but the work of a great leader is to turn obstacles into stepping stones. Quaid-e-Azam did the same for the Muslims of the Indian Subcontinent.</p>

        <blockquote>“Jinnah contributed more than any other man to Pakistan’s survival.”<br>— Richard Symons</blockquote>

        <p>He is the founder of Pakistan. He was a great leader. He was born in Karachi on 25th December 1876. His father, Mr. Pooja Jinnah, was a famous businessman. After being taught at home, Jinnah was sent in 1887 to Sindh Madrassa-tul-Islam. Later, he attended the Christian Missionary Society High School. At the age of 16, he passed the matriculation examination. He went abroad for higher studies. He had made up his mind to become a barrister, and no one could change his decision because he was a resolute man.</p>

        <blockquote>“Once you have taken a decision, stand by it as a man.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>He joined Lincoln’s Inn and obtained a degree in law. After that, he started his legal practice. Jinnah entered politics by participating in the 1906 session of the Indian National Congress. Initially, Jinnah wanted the unity of Muslims and Hindus, but soon, he said:</p>

        <blockquote>“India is not a nation, nor a country. It is a subcontinent of different nations, in which Muslims have their own distinctive identity!”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>Quaid-e-Azam openly opposed the idea of a united India. He wanted a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Indian Subcontinent. As he once said:</p>

        <blockquote>“Any idea of a united India would lead us to terrific disaster!”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>Quaid-e-Azam joined the Muslim League and united the Muslims on one platform. He asked the Muslims to stand up for their homeland and guided them towards independence.</p>

        <blockquote>“Jinnah is the only Muslim in India to whom the community has a right to look up for safe guidance.”<br>— Allama Iqbal</blockquote>

        <p>He asked the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent to unite and fight against the British rulers. He gave them hope.</p>

        <blockquote>“My message to all of you is hope, courage, and confidence.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>In 1940, he presented the demand to divide the subcontinent. It is well known as the Lahore Resolution, also called the Pakistan Resolution. He faced strong opposition from Hindus and the British but remained steadfast.</p>

        <blockquote>“Let us plan to build, reconstruct, and regenerate our great nation.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>As a result of his endless efforts, Pakistan came into being on 14th August 1947. He was appointed as the first Governor-General of Pakistan. He once said:</p>

        <blockquote>“Failure is a word unknown to me.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>He urged the whole nation to work for the integrity of Pakistan. He himself worked tirelessly as Governor-General. He focused on maintaining law and order and reducing poverty.</p>

        <blockquote>“The first duty of the government is to maintain law that protects life, property, and religious beliefs of its subjects.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>Quaid-e-Azam fully allowed minorities to practice their religion freely. He gave them their rights and assured their safety.</p>

        <blockquote>“You are free; you are free to go to your religious places!”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>Quaid-e-Azam also greatly respected women. He wanted them to have equal rights as men. He declared on many occasions that women are the building blocks of a nation.</p>

        <blockquote>“No nation is worthy of its existence that cannot take its women along with its men!”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>He always encouraged the Muslim Ummah and advised them to work hard.</p>

        <blockquote>“Don’t be overwhelmed with the enormity of tasks.”<br>— Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>

        <p>Due to his immense hard work, Quaid-e-Azam became weak. Since 1930, he had been suffering from tuberculosis (TB), but only his sister, Fatima Jinnah, and a few others were aware of his illness. He passed away on 11th September 1948.</p>

        <blockquote>“Strong flowers decay, but a great name shall never pass away!”<br>— Longfellow</blockquote>
