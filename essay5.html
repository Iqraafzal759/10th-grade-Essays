        <h1>Sports & Games</h1>

        <blockquote>“Sports is a preserver of health!”<br>— Hippocrates</blockquote>

        <p>Sports and games play an essential role in the development of human personality. They are an integral part of our lives and are equally important as food and fresh water. They have a significant impact on both our physical and mental health.</p>

        <p>Sports and games keep our bodies active and vigorous. They enable us to face challenges with bravery and valor. Not only do they instill courage, but they also provide amusement. Thus, we can define sports and games as:</p>

        <blockquote>“Any activity that involves physical or mental exertion and provides entertainment is called a game.”</blockquote>

        <p>Sports and games can be classified into two categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Indoor games</li>
            <li>Outdoor games</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Indoor games are those played inside a house, such as badminton, table tennis, and card games. On the other hand, outdoor games are played in open grounds, such as cricket, football, and hockey. Sports and games help develop many admirable qualities, including:</p>

        <blockquote>“If you want to shine like a star, first burn like a sun.”<br>— A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</blockquote>

        <p>Confidence is another quality gained through sports and games. They build self-assurance and boost energy levels. Confidence is essential for achieving any goal in life.</p>

        <blockquote>“Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.”<br>— Helen Keller</blockquote>

        <p>Sports and games emphasize confidence, enabling us to perform the fundamental tasks of life with the same enthusiasm.</p>

        <blockquote>“The first wealth is health.”<br>— Emerson</blockquote>

        <p>Health is the greatest blessing of Allah Almighty and one of the most precious aspects of life. A healthy person is more productive and innovative than an ill one.</p>

        <blockquote>“A healthy mind can realize Allah Almighty.”<br>— Hazrat Ali</blockquote>

        <p>Besides food and water, sports keep us healthy. They significantly impact both mental and physical well-being.</p>

        <blockquote>“A strong body has a strong mind.”<br>— Thales</blockquote>

        <p>Another valuable trait learned from sports and games is discipline. Discipline involves following rules and maintaining self-control, both of which are essential for success. Every athlete must possess this quality.</p>

        <blockquote>“Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.”<br>— Jim Rohn</blockquote>

        <p>Developed countries like the USA, UK, Germany, and France have made sports an essential part of education at the school level.</p>

        <blockquote>“Countries promoting sports and games for their bright future!”</blockquote>

        <p>These nations have training centers where boys and girls are trained to become future athletes, gymnasts, and sports professionals. Sports and games are also gaining popularity in Pakistan, but more efforts are needed. Pakistani boys and girls must fully understand that:</p>

        <blockquote>“All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.”<br>— James Howell</blockquote>

        <p>The government of Pakistan should pass an ordinance to promote sports and games publicly. The private sector should also contribute by establishing training centers to foster a healthy society.</p>
