        <h1>My Neighbours</h1>

        <p>"Good neighbours are priceless treasures."</p>

        <p>I have many neighbours, most of whom are extremely nice, but the best family among them lives on our right side. Mr. Shayam is the name of our neighbour. He is a doctor by profession. He is married and has two children. His wife is a very civilized and humble lady. Their sons are my age, and we go to school together.</p>

        <blockquote>“A good neighbour increases the value of your property.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>I often visit his house after school. His wife offers me chocolates and snacks. She and my mother spend a lot of time together. Mr. Shayam is a very hardworking person. He is a well-reputed man in our locality. Everyone likes him because he is soft-spoken and kind-hearted.</p>

        <blockquote>“A true neighbour is someone you can count on when times get tough.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>He always has a smile on his face. He regularly goes for an evening walk. Sometimes, his son and I accompany him. I often ask him to help me with my assignments, and I am impressed by his general knowledge.</p>

        <blockquote>“Your neighbour is the one who needs you.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>I enjoy spending time with him to learn and expand my knowledge. He has inspired me in many ways. The people in my area trust him a lot. If there is a dispute between two neighbours, he is often asked to settle it. We get along quite well with him because of his polite nature.</p>

        <p>He knows how to deal with his patients. He has come to treat me many times in the middle of the night. He never charges a fee for attending to any patient in our society. If there is an emergency, he does not hesitate for a second to help the patient, even if it is late at night.</p>

        <blockquote>“Kindness is the language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”<br>— Mark Twain</blockquote>

        <p>It has been a year since they shifted to our area, yet no one has ever seen his family arguing about anything. They are the nicest and humblest people in my neighborhood. They are very generous and try to help everyone around. Despite their wealth and status, they are not proud or arrogant. Every year, their family organizes charity events in our area to raise funds for poor people.</p>

        <blockquote>“Neighborhoods are successful when they are built on a foundation of unity.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>Our families share a very strong bond. We share all our joys and sorrows like a family. Whenever my mom prepares something special, she always makes sure to send some to them too. We always remember them on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, and gatherings. We are very attached to their family. Sometimes, when we are away from home, we still miss and think about them.</p>

        <blockquote>“Love thy neighbour as thyself.”<br>— Matthew 22:39</blockquote>

        <p>My family is very lucky to have such good neighbours. I wish that everyone is fortunate enough to have neighbours like mine.</p>

        <blockquote>“In every neighborhood, there is at least one person who makes the place special.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>
