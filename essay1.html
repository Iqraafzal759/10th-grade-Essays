        <h1>My Last Day at School</h1>

        <blockquote>“What peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How sweet their memory still!”<br>— Cowper</blockquote>

        <p>Sweet memories are like sweet-smelling flowers grown along the strenuous path of life. Though they transform life into a blooming and beaming garden, genuine wisdom is often showered from the dark clouds of painful experiences. The person who learns nothing from the past should expect nothing from a fragrant future because:</p>

        <blockquote>“What is bitter to bear may be rosy to remember.”</blockquote>

        <p>My last day at school is a memorable experience in my life. No doubt, it is also a bit bitter, but it will forever shine in my mind’s eye like a smiling tear. It is marked with anxiety, sadness, and well wishes. It was the day when I parted from my dear friends. The good past days came to mind, and their remembrance sometimes made me sad and at other times delighted.</p>

        <blockquote>“When can you feel happiness and sorrow at the same time? On the last day of school!”</blockquote>

        <p>In every school, there is a tradition that junior students give a farewell party to the outgoing seniors. In our school, every year, the students of the 9th class give a farewell to the 10th class students who are departing for their board examinations. Although leaving school is always sad, the farewell party makes the last day at school a memorable occasion for the students.</p>

        <blockquote>“The quality of a school is measured more by the kind of student it turns out than by the kind it takes in.”<br>— Robert J. Kibbee</blockquote>

        <p>On this day, both students and teachers organized a wonderful function under the supervision of the vice principal. On my last day at school, I got ready early in the morning and reached school at about 8:00 AM with my friends to spend the whole day there. It was a chilly but sunny day.</p>

        <p>The farewell party was to be held in a big hall. The function started at 10:00 AM. All the students sat peacefully, along with the worthy principal and teachers. As the principal entered the hall, all the students and teachers rose from their chairs to welcome him. The ceremony began with verses from the Holy Quran. Someone has rightly said:</p>

        <blockquote>“The first day of school turned strangers into friends. The last day turned friends into strangers with memories.”</blockquote>

        <p>First, a student from the 9th class rose to speak. She appreciated our behavior and interactions with them. She recalled the good events and joyful days spent with us and then bade us farewell. Then, on behalf of my class, I was asked to say a few words. I thanked the 9th class students for arranging such a grand party. I also thanked the teachers and office staff for their guidance and cooperation during our stay at school. Someone has rightly said:</p>

        <blockquote>“Goodbyes are not forever. Goodbyes are not the end. They simply mean I’ll miss you until we meet again!”</blockquote>

        <p>My feelings at that time were a mixture of joy and sadness. Then the principal rose to speak. He shared various valuable and practical tips beneficial for our examinations. He reminded us of our responsibilities as students and as citizens of the state. He encouraged us to fight against evils and urged us to work hard. Moreover, he also advised us:</p>

        <blockquote>“The purpose of life is to live a life of purpose. As long as you live, keep learning how to live!”</blockquote>

        <p>After the ceremony was over, we were served chicken biryani, chicken korma, and naan. We enjoyed the meal thoroughly. We talked to each other while eating, and everyone was engaged in conversation with someone. The dining hall was filled with waves of laughter. I cannot forget the taste of that meal. I miss that day so much.</p>

        <p>After the meal was over, we met our teachers one by one. They were all friendly and helpful. They gave us tips and guidance for our future life and career planning. They shared pieces of advice, and we thanked them wholeheartedly. We also met our juniors and expressed our gratitude for the wonderful farewell.</p>

        <blockquote>“School inspired me to think differently. It’s like no other time in your life!”</blockquote>

        <p>At 3:30 PM, I left for home with a heavy heart after embracing my best friends in a rain of tears. I was not feeling well while returning home. I could not sleep that night. Tears fell from my eyes as I tried to sleep, overwhelmed by the painful fact that my school life had ended.</p>

        <blockquote>“Farewell, my friends, farewell, my foes. My love is with thee, my care for those!”<br>— Robert Burns</blockquote>
