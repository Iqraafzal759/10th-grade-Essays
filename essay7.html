        <h1>A Cricket Match</h1>

        <p>Sports and games play an important role in the development of our lives. They are as beneficial as food and water. They make us healthy. As we know:</p>

        <blockquote>“The first wealth is health.”<br>— Emerson</blockquote>

        <p>Being healthy is one of the basic needs of life, and the things that make us healthy, active, and smart are sports.</p>

        <blockquote>“Sport is a preserver of health.”<br>— Hippocrates</blockquote>

        <p>There are many indoor as well as outdoor games. All games, including cricket, teach us many good qualities. They teach us to be confident, as confidence is needed in almost every field of life.</p>

        <blockquote>“Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.”<br>— Helen Keller</blockquote>

        <p>A cricket match teaches us to follow values. It makes us disciplined. Discipline is the practice of making people obey rules and laws. It is important, as it leads to a successful and meaningful life.</p>

        <blockquote>“Discipline is a bridge between goals and accomplishment.”<br>— Jim Rohn</blockquote>

        <p>Pakistani students also actively participate in cricket. They play cricket just like other games because they know very well that:</p>

        <blockquote>“All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.”<br>— James Howell</blockquote>

        <p>Cricket is an interesting game—a game that develops discipline, team spirit, cooperation, and sportsmanship.</p>

        <blockquote>“Many continentals think life is a game; the English think cricket is a game.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>Some Pakistani players are famous all over the world. Last winter, I watched a cricket match in Faisalabad. It was played between the Pakistani cricket team and the West Indies cricket team at Iqbal Stadium. There was a huge gathering at the stadium. Leading Pakistani cricketers participated in this match. I witnessed the fine game of Inzamam-ul-Haq. He scored a brilliant 75 runs in 100 deliveries, hitting eight fours and two towering sixes.</p>

        <blockquote>“A gun is no more dangerous than a cricket bat in the hands of a madman.”<br>— Unknown</blockquote>

        <p>The Pakistani team made 219 runs. Then, the West Indies took their turn. Lara played until the end and scored a century, hitting three sixes. There was a tremendous cheer from the spectators.</p>

        <blockquote>“A true batsman, in most of his strokes, tells the truth about himself.”<br>— Neville Cardus</blockquote>

        <p>The Greens scored magnificent runs, and Javed impressed the spectators with his strokes. He dominated the rival bowlers and hit his first century in the tournament.</p>

        <blockquote>“If we play good cricket, we should win.”<br>— Rahul Dravid</blockquote>

        <p>Everybody was in high spirits. The West Indians scored 203 runs. Some of their players performed poorly. Only Lara and Chander Paul played brilliantly, delighting the audience with their strokes and a couple of towering sixes.</p>

        <blockquote>“If you play good cricket, a lot of bad things get hidden.”<br>— Kapil Dev</blockquote>

        <p>The West Indies lost the match by 16 runs. The cricket fans were very happy and raised slogans:</p>

        <blockquote>“PAKISTAN ZINDABAD.”<br>— Spectators</blockquote>

        <blockquote>“The team which handles the pressure best carries the day.”<br>— Imran Khan</blockquote>
