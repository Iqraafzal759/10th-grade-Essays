        <h1>Courtesy</h1>

        <p>Courtesy is the practice of showing kindness, respect, and consideration to others. It is a fundamental part of good manners and plays a crucial role in building positive relationships and a harmonious society. Courtesy is expressed through simple actions like saying "please" and "thank you," holding the door for someone, or simply listening when someone is speaking. As William Wordsworth once said,</p>

        <blockquote>"The best portion of a good man's life is his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love." — <strong>William Wordsworth</strong></blockquote>

        <p>These small gestures may seem minor, but they have a significant impact on our interactions and the way people feel. Being courteous means thinking about others' feelings and needs. When we speak politely and act with respect, we show that we care about the other person. The golden rule,</p>

        <blockquote>"Treat others the way you want to be treated." — <strong>Unknown</strong></blockquote>

        <p>reminds us that our actions have an effect on those around us. When we are kind and respectful, we create a friendly environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated.</p>

        <blockquote>"Manners cost nothing, but they mean everything." — <strong>Unknown</strong></blockquote>

        <p>Courtesy is important in every aspect of life—whether at home, school, or in public. At home, being courteous helps build strong and happy relationships with family members. Simple things like helping with chores, speaking nicely, and being patient contribute to a pleasant home environment. In school, courtesy makes it easier to get along with classmates and teachers. A kind word or a friendly smile can brighten someone's day and help everyone work together smoothly.</p>

        <blockquote>"Life is short, but there is always time for courtesy." — <strong>Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></blockquote>

        <p>In public, courtesy helps maintain peace and order. Small acts like letting someone go ahead in line or saying "excuse me" when passing by make public spaces more enjoyable for everyone.</p>

        <blockquote>"Politeness is the flower of humanity." — <strong>Joseph Joubert</strong></blockquote>

        <p>Courtesy is a simple yet powerful way to show kindness and respect to others. It makes our interactions more pleasant and helps create a positive and caring world. As the famous quote goes,</p>

        <blockquote>"A little courtesy goes a long way." — <strong>Unknown</strong></blockquote>

        <p>By practicing courtesy every day, we can make life better not only for ourselves but for everyone around us.</p>
