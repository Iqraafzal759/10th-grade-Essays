        <h1>Allama Muhammad Iqbal</h1>

        <p>“A hero is a man who does what he can.”<br>— Romain Rolland</p>

        <p>History remembers those whose noble deeds shape the destiny of nations. Many great personalities—scientists, philosophers, poets, and leaders—have dedicated their lives to the welfare of humanity. Although they may no longer be with us, their contributions make them immortal. Among them, Allama Muhammad Iqbal holds a special place in the hearts of Muslims.</p>

        <blockquote>“Time makes heroes but dissolves celebrities.”<br>— Daniel J. Boorstin</blockquote>

        <p>Allama Iqbal, the great poet-philosopher of the Muslim world, was born in Sialkot on November 9, 1877. His father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad, was a deeply religious man, and Iqbal inherited his spiritual inclination. His teacher, Syed Mir Hassan, played a crucial role in shaping his personality by teaching him Arabic, Islamiyat, and Persian.</p>

        <blockquote>“A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning.”<br>— Brad Henry</blockquote>

        <p>After completing his early education, Iqbal moved to Lahore, where he joined Government College and earned a Master’s degree in Philosophy. He then began teaching at the same institution. Later, he traveled to Europe for higher education, earning a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Germany and qualifying as a lawyer in London. Upon his return, he started practicing law at Lahore High Court but remained deeply involved in poetry, philosophy, and religious thought.</p>

        <blockquote>“Hard times don’t create heroes. It is during hard times that the ‘hero’ within us is revealed.”<br>— Bob Riley</blockquote>

        <p>Iqbal was deeply concerned about the declining state of Muslims in the subcontinent. He saw that they had strayed from the teachings of Islam and had become engrossed in worldly desires. Through his poetry, he awakened a sense of self-respect, discipline, and love for religion among Muslims. His concepts of "Khudi" (self-identity), "Mard-e-Momin" (true believer), and "Shaheen" (falcon) inspired them to reclaim their lost dignity.</p>

        <blockquote>“Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.”<br>— William Wordsworth</blockquote>

        <p>Iqbal’s most remarkable contribution was his vision of a separate homeland for Muslims. In 1930, he presided over the Allahabad Session of the All-India Muslim League, where he clearly stated that Muslims needed an independent state to live according to Islamic principles. This laid the foundation for the creation of Pakistan.</p>

        <blockquote>“Rise above sectional interests and private ambitions. Pass from matter to spirit. Matter is diversity; spirit is light, life, and unity!”<br>— Allama Iqbal</blockquote>

        <p>Sadly, Iqbal did not live to see his dream fulfilled. He passed away on April 21, 1938, and was buried in Lahore, near Minar-e-Pakistan—a monument that later symbolized the realization of his vision.</p>

        <blockquote>“Greatness is nothing unless it is lasting.”<br>— Napoleon Bonaparte</blockquote>

        <p>Allama Iqbal is not only remembered as the "Poet of the East" but also as a guiding force behind the creation of Pakistan. His poetry continues to inspire millions, urging them to strive for greatness, self-discovery, and unity. His legacy remains a source of pride for the entire Muslim world.</p>
